        <p> Nutrious and thirst clenching, with the need to fight off ham pirates...</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 10-pound canned ham</li>
            <li>1 hunting knife</li>
            <li>3 q-litre bottles of rum</li>
            <li>1 handgun</li>
            <li>1 box of handgun ammo</li>
            <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <Ol>
            <li>De-can ham.</li>
            <li>Using the hunting knife, carve a hole in the top of the ham wide enough to hold the mouth of a rum bottle.</li>
            <li>Open first rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole. If you made your hole deep enough, it should stand up there on it's own.</li>
            <li>Load gun.</li>
            <li>Open second rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole (the one in your face this time). As the liquid flows into your mouth, swallow at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>Repeat step five until bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>Open third bottle of rum and repeat step six.</li>
            <li>Remove safety from handgun.</li>
            <li>Wait for ham pirates.</li>
            <li>Shoow ham pirates</li>
            <li>Reload gun.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps eight through eleven until rum has been fully absorbed into ham, usually about twelve hours.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
